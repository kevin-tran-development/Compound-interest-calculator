Compound Interest Calculator Project

This project focuses on the principles of the sequencing structure

* Purpose: To compute and display the future value of an investment using the principal amount, interest rate, number of years, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year. 
* 
* Input: Investment amount, annual interest rate in percentage, compound period, and number of years left to earn interest.
* 
* Process: Using the formula where to get the future value, you must determine what the rate of the return is by adding 1 to the annual interest rate divided by compounds. Then you take the principal amount and multiply it with the value of the rate of return to the power of compounds multiplied by the years of the term.
* 
* Output: Future value of the investment, investment amount, annual interest rate, compounds per year, and the years of the term.
